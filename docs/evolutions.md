## VEAF issue #3 — `cleanUp()` leaves `harmSilenceID` stale

**Issue:** https://github.com/VEAF/Skynet-IADS/issues/3

**Suggested fix (from the issue):** have `cleanUp()` clear what it cancels:

```lua
SkynetIADSUtils.removeFunction(self.harmScanID)
self.harmScanID = nil
SkynetIADSUtils.removeFunction(self.harmSilenceID)
self.harmSilenceID = nil
self.harmShutdownTime = 0
```

or simply call `finishHarmDefence`.

**Rough steps:**
- Apply the fix in `skynet-iads-abstract-radar-element.lua:75-82`
- Add a regression test. `abstract-radar-element` is NOT ported to `test/lua` yet (still on the DCS-only list). Decide: port a slice of that suite, or write a narrow standalone test that loads `SkynetIADSAbstractRadarElement`, arms a HARM silence, calls `cleanUp()`, asserts `isDefendingHARM() == false` and `harmSilenceID == nil`
- Full suite green, commit
- Close VEAF issue #3 referencing the fix

## Possible issues detected to check

Neither was requested work and neither is a confirmed bug — they are latent-robustness questions worth a look, especially because this exact failure class (one bad object aborting a whole loop) already bit the project once, in David's `458b64f` "a destroyed group truncated prefix-based discovery".

### No coalition check on weapon contacts

[skynet-iads.lua:348](../../../skynet-iads-source/skynet-iads.lua) carries a pre-existing note:

```lua
-- the DCS Radar only returns enemy aircraft, if that should change a coalition check will be required
```

`ad60e92` widened what `evaluateContacts` hands to SAM sites from "aircraft (and, by accident, missiles)" to "aircraft + weapons, minus SHELL/ROCKET" —
so **bombs and missiles are now deliberately passed**. Weapons transit friendly airspace far more than enemy aircraft do.

**Check:** does DCS radar detection (`Controller.getDetectedTargets`, which is what feeds `self.contacts`) ever surface *friendly* ordnance? If it can, a Phalanx / C-RAM could be told to engage a friendly bomb overflying the site.

**If confirmed:** gate the weapon branch on `contact:getDCSRepresentation():getCoalition()` (or check it once when the contact is built). The `ad60e92` essay in the source already flags this as "another matter" and "Note 1: we could enhance that by only turning the site on when they can indeed engage the target".

**Interesting because:** it's a behaviour change from this integration widening a surface the original author explicitly marked as coalition-unsafe.

## Smoke tests

Study how the legacy `unit-test` can be transformed into something more usable and build in-sim smoke tests. See if MCPs or such exists that can help communicate with a running DCS mission. Use of the log file is always possible but may be complex.
